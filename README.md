Notebooks to accompany our book "A guided Tour of Mathematical Methods for the Physical Sciences"

A Guided Tour of Mathematical Methods for the Physical Sciences is based on a philosophy that learning mathematics for the physical sciences, requires pen and paper. Learning by doing. Three editions in, this philosophy still holds strong, but heaps of things have happened since the first edition in 2001. Numerical methods play an ever-larger role in the physical sciences, for example. The Python programming language has really exploded on the scene, and more recently the jupyter notebook has been developed to facilitate learning numerical methods in python. To accompany the latest edition of our book - and your pen and paper - we wrote one jupyter notebook per chapter.

If you are new to jupyter notebooks and/or python, the online resources are virtually endless, and the installation -- on any operating system -- is easy with conda. We are going to assume you run python 3.
